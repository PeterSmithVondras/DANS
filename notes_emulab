What to do on emulab:
use image: DANS_UBUNTU16
You must have some storage on the machine that you set up. In the attached ns file, it is mounted to /mnt/extra
When you ssh into the machine you would like to run on in emulab do the following:
Change to root to access your block storage: $ sudo su root
Change where bazel does its caching $ bazel --output_user_root=/mnt/extra
Move to local storage: $ cd /mnt/extra
Clone the repo or cp it from your user space: $ git clone https://github.cs.tufts.edu/peter/DANS.git
compile with bazel and run as laid out in the readme.
